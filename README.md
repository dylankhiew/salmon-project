# üç£ The Salmon Project 

A project which provides a brief introduction about me and my work experience.
Why salmon? Well, one day I suddenly thought of how beautiful the color palette for **salmon** is, thats when the idea popped up.

## Libraries

Created with Create React App (TypeScript template)

- **styled-components** - Keeps the CSS neat and tidy as well as makes naming understandable.
- **lottie-react** - Adds spices of animation to the project, makes it lively!
- **react-icons** - Well you know, icons and stuff
- **react-tinder-card** - This one game changer, does most of the heavy lifting for the card swiping animation.
- **react-toggle** - Just for the dark/light mode toggle, so do utilise it!

## Running it

Feel like running it and see how it goes? It's pretty straight forward, just clone and run the commands:

```
cd salmon-project
yarn
yarn start
```
